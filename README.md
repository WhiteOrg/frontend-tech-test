# Stech Frontend Technical Challenge

Thanks for giving me the chance ðŸ‘‹

I went with an atomic design approach for this challenge and used storybook to isolate each component visually

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimises/minifies the build for the best performance.

### `npm run storybook`

Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. 
It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.
